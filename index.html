                <p class="about__description">Welcome to the College of Informatics, the path to thriving careers in
                    computer engineering and information technology.<br><br>

                    The academic programs offered by the college strive to educate students, inspire excellence in
                    research and innovation, discover new knowledge, technologies, and systems, and embrace a
                    culture of service. The college continues to conceive and develop programs to be at par with the
                    advancement of modern global technology. Combined with PCU’s long-standing tradition of providing
                    strong Christian education, the college offers a holistic education.<br><br>

                    Integrating research, strong theoretical background, and hands-on experience in laboratories and
                    practical immersions, students are given space to work in teams, develop collaboration, foster

                    <p class="history__description">In 1945, Bishop Edwin F. Lee of the <strong>United Methodist Church
                            (UMC)</strong> envisioned a Christian college in Manila. On October 6, 1946, Laymen of the
                        Evangelical Association of the Philippines agreed to the establishment of the college. Their
                        initial Board of Directors Was composed of Atty. Juan Nabong, Sr., Dr. Mateo Occena, Dr. Emilio
                        Javier, D. Mauro Baradi, and Mr. Gerardo Armonio.<br><br>On January 11, 1947, the Articles of
                        Incorporation was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The original name of
                        the institution was <strong>Manila Union University</strong> but this was later changed to
                        <strong>Philippine Christian College</strong>. Dr. Roxy Lefforge, an American missionary, was
                        the first Executive Dean.<br><br>

                        Dr. Emilio Javier (1952-1958), an outstanding layman of the <strong> United Church of Christ in
                            the Philippines (UCCP)</strong> was elected as the first President. Under his leadership the
                        institution expanded the ecumenical efforts in education. The Union High School of Manila and
                        Union Elementary School founded by the Presbyterian Church in 1919 and 1946 respectively became
                        part of PCC in 1947. The college added a degree course in Nursing when the Mary Johnston School
                        of Nursing, founded by the Methodist in 1907, affiliated with PCC in 1953.<br><br>

                        Dr. Juan Nabong, Sr. (1958-1969), a Methodist layman, was the second President. Under his
                        Administration, a four-storey concrete building was constructed in 1960 beside the UTS building
                        on Taft Avenue. A year later, a two-storey building for the Elementary school was constructed in
                        Vasquez Street, Malate. The Ellinwood College of Christian Education was merging with the
                        Philippine Christian College in 1968 and its curricular programs integrated with the programs of
                        the College of Education. Dr. Lino Q. Arquiza (1969-1988), a UCCP Educator, was the third
                        President. Under him, the growth and expansion of PCC was steady and impressive. In 1976, PCC
                        acquired its University status and Philippine Christian University. A highlight of the efforts
                        at cooperation came during Dr. Arquiza’s term when the Union Theological Seminary and PCU merge
                        in 1978. with the merger, the Philippine Christian Center for Learning (PCCL) was born.<br><br>

                        The merger enabled PCU to expand its offerings in the 97-hectare UTS campus, 36 kilometers south
                        of Manila. With this move, Philippine Christian University and Union Theological Seminary,
                        established an ecumenical relationship that is more expansive and more coordinated.
                        Institutional cooperation extended to non-protestant schools when in 1972, PCU and DLSU joined
                        hands in a resource-sharing program. This move ushered in the formation of five-school Inter
                        Institutional Consortium (I-IC) in 1975 composed of De La Salle University, St. Scholastica’s
                        College, St. Paul’s College of Manila, Philippine Normal College and Philippine Christian
                        University. The Consortium enjoys the full support of the United Board for Christian Higher
                        Education in Asia.<br><br>

                        With the untimely demise of Dr. Arquiza, PCU had a succession of two able and dedicated
                        Officers-in-Charge in the persons of Justice Crisolito Pascual (1988) and Dean Betty I. Molina
                        (1989). In 1990, the Board of Trustees elected Dr. Carlito S. Puno (1990-2000), a prominent
